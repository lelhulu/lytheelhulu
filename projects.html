        <h3>Project 1: Walk Together Design Project</h3>
        <p>The Walk Together design project shows our group’s process of
          understanding and solving a problem through a design process. The problem that our
          project centers around is that students can often feel unsafe when walking on campus
          at night. Finding other students who are still on campus at night can often be hard for
          students since most people are back home or at their dorms. They usually won’t be able
          to find anyone, unless they run into someone they know or unless they find a random
          person willing to walk with them, and even then, trusting a stranger can also be
          dangerous.

          <h3>Project 2: iWallet Design Project</h3>
          <p>
            The iWallet design project is like Apple Pay, but better. 
            It lets you keep all your cards—credit, debit, student ID, driver's license,
             health insurance, and memberships—in one easy-to-access app. 
            No more digging through your wallet; everything you need is right at your fingertips.

          <p>Teaming up with a group, I contributed to the development of a Whack-a-Mole game using C++. The game has 
            three levels and will count your score out of 20 rounds.

        <h3>Project 4: Pizza Ordering System</h3>
        <p>
          I undertook this assignment to enhance my comprehension of object-oriented programming, developing a pizza ordering system that manages orders, offers topping choices, and utilizes ArrayLists. 
          The system includes features to track uncompleted orders and a option to complete the order.

      <h3>Project 5: Banking System</h3>
      <p>
        Designed a comprehensive system for a local bank, incorporating user management for employees and customers. 
        The system facilitates the tracking of various account types, including checking, saving, and CD accounts, with the flexibility for a customer to possess multiple accounts of each type. 
        The implementation involves inheritance, where the "Account" class is subclassed into checking, saving, and CD account types, while the "Person" class is subclassed into employee and customer categories, 
        providing a structured and modular approach to managing the bank's operations efficiently.
